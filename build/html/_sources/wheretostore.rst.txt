Where do I store my data?
==========================

Storing raw data
-----------------

Always keep backup copies of your raw data in different servers dedicated for long-term storage such as: `SRA <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra>`_, `ENA <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/>`_, EvoDevo (at RBGE).

Keep notes of your analysis detailing where your raw data is, how you can access it, the steps of the analysis etc.

You can keep a copy of your raw files in your own external hard drive, but this should NOT be your only backup.

.. important:: Never work directly on your raw data. Always keep backup copies elsewhere and make a copy of it to the server where you are working on.  

Working data
-------------

Copy your raw data to a working directory: eg. your ``home`` at Toby or ``/mnt/shared/projects`` in `HPC CropDiversity <https://help.cropdiversity.ac.uk/index.html>`_. In this directory you can analyse your data safely, knowing that you have backup copies elsewhere.
